Let's Save GAS is an App that runs on General Motors's latest car models App enabled Dashboard using GM Developers APIs 
and it was first developed at AT&T Hackathon in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 2013.

Let's Save GAS is an online/mobile community of car drivers, bikers and also pedestrians helping each other to save on gas
using crowdsourcing and gamification.

GAS prices are reported directly from the pump using an In-Vehicle App available on select General Motors(TM) cars  
such as the new Chevy Volt(TM). Members of the community are rewarded with badges and their reputation grows along with the 
quantity and quality of their reports, this adds the "gaming" element to the service, encouraging its users to submit reports.

For Drivers:

- The In-Vehicle App uses GM SDK and an data coming directly from the Car, such as geo-location, fuel level and for safety 
reasons the App on the car will detect/work only if the car is parked. 

- Drivers will see product/service offers from the participant GAS Stations on the App when they stop in one.


For the General Public (Drivers are also included):

- The Website and Mobile Apps allow users to register and sign in to the service and create new GAS/Charging Stations easily using 
a Map. Geo-coding an reverse geo-coding is used to translate latitude and longitude to addresses and geo-fencing is used to detect if the 
car is inside a gas station.


For GAS Station Owners:

- GAS Station owners can claim their locations on the website and promote their products or services for a flat 
monthly/fee.

- A report about ad views will be available.
